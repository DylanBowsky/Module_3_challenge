                                 Crypto Comparing Analyst
The goal for this notebook is to be able to compare to two seperate crypto currencies over a period of quarter one in 2018

                                 Technologies used
In this notebook we used Pandas, Pathlib, and matplotlib. If you want to change out to using seaborn for a different style of plotting that could work, but since we only were using two datasets the simple line plots worked fine.

                                 Installation
For installation we will need to install dev enviroment along with matplotlib

                                 Example
The example that was used in this notebook shows the potential arbitrage to be had when trading in crypto. It also shows the downfall if you wait longer to get into the market we see in just 3 months there was no more arbitrage opportunity, this of course for only one day to note.
